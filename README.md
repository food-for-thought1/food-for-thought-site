# Food-For-Thought1 🍅

# 🌽 - Our mission is to raise awareness about food insecurity, its causes, and its impact on marginalized communities. 

# 🍄 - As a group who has experienced food insecurities due to living in food deserts and facing high living costs, we are committed to advocating for increased access to nutritious food for all individuals and families, regardless of their income or background.

# 🥗 - Our focus is on empowering and supporting those who are most affected by food insecurity by connecting them to resources such as food pantries, benefits, and mutual aid funds like SNAP.
