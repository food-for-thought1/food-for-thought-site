                <h3>What is food insecurity?</h3>
                <p>
                    Food insecurity refers to the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active and healthy life. It is a situation where individuals or households do not have sufficient resources or means to obtain enough nutritious food to meet their dietary needs.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Certain areas in New York City, mostly those occupied by low-income people of color, have limited access to healthy food options due to unequal distribution of resources. This has resulted in higher levels of food insecurity and illnesses related to poor nutrition in these communities.

                    Why is it happening?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Food insecurity can occur due to poverty, lack of access to affordable and nutritious food, unemployment, low wages, limited transportation, natural disasters, political conflicts, and economic crises. Additionally, systemic issues like racism, discrimination, and inequalities in healthcare and education can also contribute to food insecurity.

            </h2>
            <p>
                A household suffers from food insecurity when it cannot, at times, access adequate food for everyone in the home due to a lack of resources, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA reported 32.1% of households with annual incomes below the official poverty line were food insecure in 2021. National rates of food insecurity were highest for households headed by single mothers at 24.3%, as well as households headed by African Americans (19.8%) and Hispanics (16.2%) in 2021.

            <p>
                In a city as wealthy as New York, it's only fair that everyone has access to healthy food options. Each community should have a say in what foods are available to them and every individual deserves enough nutritious food to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's important for local food businesses to reflect the unique cultures and diversity of each neighborhood.
